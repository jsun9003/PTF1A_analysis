# PTF1A drives multiscale 3D genome rewiring during somatic cell reprogramming into neural stem cells

<div style="text-align: justify"> Genomes are complex 3D structures that are partitioned into chromatin compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs) and loops, and are unique to each cell type. How this higher-order genome organization regulates cell fate transition during differentiation remains poorly understood at present. Here we show how a single non-neural progenitor transcription factor, PTF1A, reorchestrates the 3D genome to control gene expression during fibroblast transdifferentiation into neural stem cells (NSCs). By multiomics analyses integrating the Hi-C data, PTF1A and CTCF DNA-binding profiles, H3K27ac modification, and gene expression, we demonstrate that PTF1A facilitates the switch of chromatin compartment B to compartment A, reinforces insulation by binding to and recruiting CTCF to TADs with weak boundaries, and modifies both inter-TAD and intra-TAD loops. Consequently, these alterations in the 3D genome landscape leads to gene expression changes that drive somatic cell transdifferentiation into NSCs. Moreover, PTF1A mediates H3K27ac deposition to activate enhancers and super-enhancers near weak boundaries, which promotes cell fate transitions. Together, our data implicate 3D genome reorganization as a driving force instrumental for cellular transcription program changes and cell fate transitions, and highlight an essential role for PTF1A in orchestrating multiscale 3D genome remodeling during cell reprogramming. </div>
